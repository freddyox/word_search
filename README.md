# Word Search Generator and Game
* A fully functional word search game.
* About 300 words are randomly selected from a dictionary of over 300k words. From here, I randomly choose words based on string length which allows me to adjust the game difficulty, e.g. I can choose more smaller words (words with a smaller length) making the game more difficult for the user.
* The game is built using the <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/">SFML multimedia library</a> which means everything has been built from scratch, including the word search board, user interactions, sprite movements (the check/unchecked box), and dynamically built colors to make finding words easier for the user. The program includes sounds as well!
* A description of the program may be found <a href="https://freddyox.github.io/blog/word-search/">here</a>, but here is an example:
